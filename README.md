# Nimiq Python Client

> Python implementation of the Nimiq RPC client specs.

## Usage

*Placeholder; Rather than starting to delve into the API docs, it'd be great to see what the client looks like in action in this lang plus a rough description what it does. The dev should be able to quickly determine whether the example fits the desired style and problem.*

## API

*Placeholder; All the implemented methods with parameters, types, default values, return types*

## Installation

*Placeholder; how to add this client to a project. Each language comes with a package manager. To be useful for developers, add a package description file that works with the most commonly used package manager for this language. For example have a `package.json` file for JavaScript or `pom.xml` for Java.*
